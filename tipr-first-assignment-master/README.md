# tipr-first-assignment
Hola, amigos!

This is going to be the first assignment of TIPR-2019. The problems in this assignment revolve around the concepts like Locality sensitive hashing(LSH), Random Projections and PCA. These are techniques for converting higher-dimensional data to lower-dimension without losing significant information.

It also encompasses two very important classifiers - Naive Bayes and Nearest Neighbour. You'll be evaluating the performance of these classifiers on various real-life datasets.

Hope you all will enjoy the assignment. Best of luck. HAPPY PYTHONING!
